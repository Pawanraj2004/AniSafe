# AniSafe
"Safeguarding Wildlife, One Road at a Time" A one step solution for solving the challenge of animal road safety by using AI, IoT and 3D-Models of infrastructure.
## The problem AniSafe solves
Road accidents involving animals pose a significant risk to both wildlife and human life. 
<br>These accidents not only lead to the loss of animal lives but can also result in severe injuries or fatalities for humans, as well as damage to vehicles.
<br> **Key problems addressed include :**
- Lack of awareness about road safety concerning animals, leading to frequent animal-vehicle collisions.
- Insufficient infrastructure to detect and warn about animals crossing the road, especially at night or in remote areas.
- Difficulty in tracking high-incident zones of animal accidents and taking preventive measures.
- Limited education among the public, especially children and youth, regarding road safety and animal protection.<br>
AniSafe provides a comprehensive solution by using AI, IoT, and interactive education tools to prevent accidents, raise awareness, and engage communities in animal safety initiatives.

## Challenges we ran into
**1.AI Model Training:**
Collecting and annotating sufficient data for accurate animal detection in diverse lighting conditions.<br>
**2.Night-Time Detection:**
Ensuring reliable detection during low visibility with the use of IR sensors.<br>
**3.Real-Time Alerting:**
Implementing a system to fetch live locations and promptly notify authorities about accidents.<br>
**4.Interactive Features:**
Creating engaging quizzes for youth education and an intuitive map interface for reporting and tracking accident hotspots.<br>
**5.Hardware Simulation:**
Designing and simulating IoT sensors with realistic accuracy for practical implementation<br>
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
